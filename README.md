## Documenting problem-solving for AI/ML Windows Development

# Working in Windows?
Windows has made leaps and bounds in terms of its native compatibility with AI/ML work. However, there are still numerous challenges that don't receive enough attention from developers as they're considered less critical development priorities. This includes several issues related to the most popular ML/AI frameworks, e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, NVIDIA CUDA libraries, Ultralytics etc.

# How can this repo help you?
I document some of these issues for my own personal interest, but I've found out that others tend to face them too. With that in mind, I've compiled relevant documents covering these issues and step-by-step fixes created with the help of Anthropic Claude!
